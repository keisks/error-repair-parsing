I rely on a compiled module for the dot-product.  This means you need to compile the module.

Should be very easy to build on unix-like machines with a c compiler.

compiling the extension module:
with cython:
   1/ install cython. (easy_install cython).  then:
   2/ pythoh setup.py build_ext --inplace

without cython:
   python setupc.py build
   then look for a 'build/' directory, inside it locate a file called ml.so or ml.pyd, and copy it to this (ml/) directory.
